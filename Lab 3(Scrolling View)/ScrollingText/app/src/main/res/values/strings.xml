    <string name="article_text" >Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will be about epidemiological evidence,
        but only the second version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in context.
        The paragraph does’t just describe the epidemiological evidence;
        it shows how epidemiology is telling the same story as etiology.
        Similarly, while Version A does’t relate to anything in particular,
        Version B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the
        biological pathway (i.e. etiology) of a disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging
        hypothesis with a different kind of evidence. As a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph
        about cells and chemicals and such relates to the paragraph about populations in different places.
        A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.
        (The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in action!)
        This placement helps readers comprehend your argument
        To see how, try this: find an <web>www.google.com</web>
        academic piece (such as a textbook or scholarly article) that strikes you as well written
        and go through part of it reading just the first sentence of each paragraph. You should be able to
        easily follow the sequence of logic. When you’re writing for professors,
        it is especially effective to put your key sentences first because they usually convey your own
        original thinking. It’s a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically composed of a telling
        key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.
        Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively.
        When you’re reading a complicated academic piece for the first time,
        you might want to go through reading only the first sentence or two of each
        paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument. Then you can go back and read all of
        it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in. And when you’re writing,
        you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph
        (instead of a topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument before getting immersed
        in sentence-level wordsmith.
        For the most part, a text reads smoothly when it conveys a thoughtful and well organized
        argument or analysis. Focus first and most on your ideas, on crafting an ambitious analysis.
        The most useful guides advise you to first focus on getting your ideas on paper and then revising
        for organization and word choice later, refining the analysis as you go.
        Thus, consider the advice here as if you already have some rough text written and are in
        the process of smoothing out your prose to clarify your argument for both your reader and yourself.</string>
